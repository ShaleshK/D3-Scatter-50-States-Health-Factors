### Using 2014 ACS estimates on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state to create scatter plots of Obesity or Income vs Poverty Percentage or Uninsured Percentage.  The scatter plot represents each state with circle elements with state abbreviations in the circles and axes and labels to the bottom of the chart.  Created a click event in javascript to enable users to click to change the X- or Y-axis to see a different factor.  Animated the transitions for state circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Bound all data from the CSV (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) to state circles.  Created tooltips so the user can see numerical data when hovering over a state circle.
